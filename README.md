<!-- **Gridfolio**
===============

**Gridfolio** is a super simple React-based portfolio generator. [Live demo >>](http://christinecha.github.io/gridfolio/)

-------------

## Quickstart

First, install packages from the root directory:

```
$ npm install
```

Next, get the server up and running:

```
$ npm start
```


You should then be able to access Gridfolio at this URL:
<https://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server>

## Customization (basic)

#### Adding/Updating Content

All of the content in your Gridfolio is contained in the `Folio` variable in `myGridfolio.js`. Everything follows this simple structure:

```
Folio = [
  [ {Block}, {Block}, {Block} ],     // Row of 3 Blocks
  [ {Block} ],                       // Row of 1 Block
  [ {Block}, {Block} ],              // Row of 2 Blocks
  ...                                // etc.
]
```

Each `Block` is just an object, filled with some basic info:

```
{
  title: "My Project",
  link: "https://github.com/christinecha/gridfolio",
  image: "https://image.com/image.png"
}
```

You'll see some extra stuff, like:

```
{
  ...
  titleColor: '#818182',
  titleFontSize: 16,
  customHeight: 0.03,
  borderRadius: '0'
}
```

These are essentially Block-specific styles that are overriding the default Style Guide. Which is a nice segue to the next section ---


#### Customizing the Design

As you might have seen in `myGridfolio.js`, we're importing our styles from `myGridfolioStyles.js`. Using the wonderful "destructuring" capabilities of ES6, we can use the style of our choice like so:

```
export const FolioStyle = style.Default
```

or, if you create your own new style object:

```
export const FolioStyle = style.Unique_Style_Name
```

In `myGridfolioStyles.js`, the structure is basically this:

```
Unique_Style_Name = {
  body: {},           // styles for the whole page
  block: {            // default styles for each Block
    title: {},        // default styles for each Title
    keywords: {},     // default styles for each Keyword Container
    keyword: {}       // default styles for each Keyword
  }
}
```

Remember, you can always override styles within each Block in `myGridfolio.js`. -->
